# TODO 1: Add "communication" to required_skills if it's not already there.
# TODO 2: Find out which skills the candidate has that are also required.
# TODO 3: Find out all unique skills possessed by either (required or candidate).
# TODO 4: Which skills are required but the candidate doesn't have?
